# SMILE 2.0 - 3D Viewer, Animation Editor

Native-first reusable inspection and lightweight pose-correction tool. Arin v5.7 is the default; Profile cycles Arin v5.6, the earlier prototype, and the technical fixture. Web editor feature work is deferred.

The editor source and build/launch entry points belong here. Sin Star I owns the self-contained character package at `games\SinStarI\SourceAssets\Characters\Paladin\ArinV57`. Do not edit ignored cooking inputs as canonical character assets.

## Build and launch

Run `Build.ps1`, then `Launch.ps1`. The regular launcher defaults to `bin\Character3DViewer.exe`. The active Debug development build is `bin\Debug\Character3DViewer.exe`; pass that absolute path with `Launch.ps1 -Executable` to launch it. The launcher exports live calibration, closes old instances, preserves/restores the stable working copy and watches saves to mirror them into the canonical repository JSON.

## Inspection

- Backtick cycles through panels hidden (including Pose Calibration), all UI hidden, then the prior UI restored. Headers, the timeline, and helper text remain after the first tap. Hidden controls cannot intercept the mouse. This does not change panel-open preferences, edits, playback, or the camera. Right-click reset restores the normal UI with Pose Calibration hidden.
- Space pauses/resumes movement while keeping camera controls active.
- Flames keep animating when Space pauses the scene. The separate Pause Flames / Play Flames button controls only the flames, independently of scene playback. Reset starts both again.
- Right-click resets presentation as on a fresh launch: Idle, Demo, dragon/floor/grid visible, landscape backdrop, unpaused. There is no inactivity timer that re-enables Demo.
- Left drag pans the view; middle drag orbits; wheel zooms smoothly.
- H Orbit, V Orbit and Zoom support hover-wheel adjustment and capture slider drags until release, even outside the track. Vertical orbit supports 360 degrees.
- Demo completes at least three whole loops and at least five seconds before advancing. Selecting an animation disables Demo and loops that clip.
- D toggles the dragon; W toggles sword; S toggles shield. Hiding the dragon does not shrink the arena.
- B/BG cycles colors and two static bitmaps. The default is the Sin Star I landscape without its title.
- Floor / Grid hides/shows both. Profile, Glow, Socket, Channel and lighting controls remain available.
- Pose shows/hides Pose Calibration, which is **hidden at startup and reset**.
- Sword Fire and Shield Fire independently toggle the default-on thermal effects on Arin v5.7. W/S also hide the corresponding fire with its equipment. The sword has a fuller orange flame and world-space lingering trail; the shield uses much smaller flames instead of the old solid golden glow.
- Normal animation loop wraps and clip changes retain existing fire particles until they fade; source velocity inheritance is zeroed for the transition update so the pose reset does not launch particles across the gap. Editing a paused pose clears stale emission. Explicit right-click reset clears the effects for a fresh start.

The timeline supports drag scrubbing and hover-wheel single-frame steps. `0-Frame` jumps to the start; `< Key` / `Key >` jump between saved corrections; `< Frame` / `Frame >` step immediately on click and repeat one frame every 300 ms while held. Release stops repetition; reset or hiding the UI cancels it. Holding captures the gesture so it cannot pan the camera; a delayed update never catches up with a burst of frame steps. Drag a green keyframe tick to move it. These controls do not toggle pause.

## Pose corrections

Select Sword Wrist, Shield Wrist, Sword or Shield, an axis, and Rotate or Move. The slider and hover-wheel edit the selected channel; the former -5/+5 buttons are removed. Decouple switches allow each equipment item to retain its base animation while its wrist is corrected independently.

To turn a fitted sword or shield without pulling its grip away, select **Sword** or **Shield**, enable **In Place**, choose **Rotate**, then adjust X/Y/Z. This holds the equipment's current hand-attachment point while compensating its position offsets; it does not edit either wrist. Save Frame stores the resulting rotation and position together in the existing format. Cancel/Reload restores both. The control is an editing mode, not another animated property. Position compensation retains the existing whole-world-unit precision and rejects edits beyond the saved +/-100-unit range.

`Save Frame` stores the entire correction snapshot (all 20 channels, including both equipment coupling flags), not just the visible axis. There are up to 256 keys per clip. One key is held throughout a clip; multiple keys interpolate between frames, using shortest-path rotation and cyclic interpolation for loops.

Prev Key / Next Key navigate; Delete Key removes the current saved key. Copy Key / Paste Key transfer complete snapshots. Reload Key discards unsaved changes and restores saved corrections. Reset resets the selected target's correction values; Delete All Key Frames clears only this animation's saved keys after the Confirm Current Clip confirmation. There is no Reset All button. Save Frame and Cancel are together in the lower-right corner of Pose Calibration.

Saved JSON is `games\SinStarI\SourceAssets\Characters\Paladin\ArinV57\Calibration\arin-v5.7-pose-calibration.json`. Its full path appears below the timeline in muted gray at the original 9-point size; click it to select the file in Explorer. It remains visible with panels hidden, and hides with the full UI. Runtime binary Save Data is disposable infrastructure, not the repository source of truth. Before committing calibration changes, run `scripts\sync-arin-v5-7-calibration.ps1 -Mode Export -AllowMissing`.

## Shared presentation libraries

- `Smile.Simple3D.Arena3D`: black floor and one emissive grid mesh, configurable dimensions, tile spacing, thickness and color. Viewer uses blue; Fire Lab uses orange and independently configured larger tiles.
- `Smile.Simple3D.StaticBackdrop3D`: load/select/clear/destroy a screen-fixed backdrop, shared with Fire Lab. No world plane or camera-driven positioning.
- `Smile.UI.Controls`: matching panels, buttons, slider drawing, hover hit-testing and exclusive drag capture.

These effects do not modify Arin's models, rig or animation sources. The canonical descriptor supplies mesh-derived sword endpoints and shield flame anchors; the rendered equipment transform, including calibration and decoupling, positions the emitters. Existing saved keys remain valid. The sword keeps a fiery outline under its flames; the shield's old golden overlay and glow trail are not drawn when the thermal equipment preview is available.
